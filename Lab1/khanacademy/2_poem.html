    <h2>Web development</h2>
     <p>
         In the land of code, where pixels bloom,<br>
A silent art fills every room.<br>
With keystrokes light, the canvas grows,<br>
A digital world, where magic flows.<br><br>

HTML, the structure's bone,<br>
The skeleton that stands alone.<br>
With tags and elements, crisp and clear,<br>
A framework built with love and care.<br><br>

CSS, the painter's brush,<br>
Colors spread in a gentle hush.<br>
Borders, shadows, fonts aligned,<br>
Beauty crafted, by design.<br><br>

JavaScript, the beating heart,<br>
Breathing life into the art.<br>
Events and logic, loops that spin,<br>
An endless dance, a world within.<br><br>

APIs, the messengers true,<br>
Bridging worlds, both old and new. <br>
A handshake here, a call out there,<br>
Data flows through the digital air.<br><br>

In every byte, a dream concealed,<br>
In every line, a thought revealed.<br>
The web unfolds, a living page,<br>
A timeless craft, a boundless stage.<br><br>

So raise your glass, to those who weave,<br>
The threads of wonder we perceive.<br>
For web developers, bold and free,<br>
Are builders of our destiny.
